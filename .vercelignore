# Potentially the src folder IF all necessary logic from src
# is implicitly included via imports in api/predict.py and installed dependencies.
# Vercel's build process should handle including necessary imports,
# but explicitly ignoring `src/` *might* sometimes help if it's large and not directly copied.
# Test deployment WITH and WITHOUT the line below:
# src/

# Other artifacts
model.joblib # <-- Add this ONLY IF you are loading the model from an external source (like S3) in predict.py instead of bundling it. If bundled, DO NOT add this line.
